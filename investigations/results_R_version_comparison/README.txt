Here I aim to confirm that the parameter values (including both the traditional 16 + the mutual information) are the same whether calculated on my deskopt with R  version 3.6.1 or my laptop which has R version 4+

If the values are the same regardless of the version used, I can continue to interchange machines for teh claculation of the parmaters at my convenience.
