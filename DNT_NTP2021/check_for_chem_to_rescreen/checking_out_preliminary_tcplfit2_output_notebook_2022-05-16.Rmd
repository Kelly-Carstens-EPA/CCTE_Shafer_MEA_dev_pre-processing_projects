This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
plotting.data <- use.dat[spid == '7126 B10' & aenm == 'CCTE_Shafer_MEA_dev_per_network_spike_spike_percent_dn']
row <- list(conc = plotting.data[, concentration_unlogged],
            resp = plotting.data[, response],
            bmed = plotting.data[, unique(bmed)],
            cutoff = plotting.data[, unique(coff)],
            onesd = plotting.data[, unique(osd)],
            name = plotting.data[, unique(spid)],
            assay = plotting.data[, unique(aenm)])
res <- concRespCore(row,fitmodels = c("cnst", "hill", "gnls", "poly1", "poly2", "pow", "exp2", "exp3",
                                      "exp4", "exp5"),conthits = T, do.plot=T)
concRespPlot(res)

# Okay, why does the curve start at 1e-03?

plotting.data[, unique(logc_min)] # -1 on log scale = 0.1 uM scale
plotting.data[, unlist(response)][1:3] # okay, so these values really are below the curve


# I think this is a moment when I am overanalyzing a bit
# In the vast majority of cases, the difference in the ac50's seems to be within +/-10% 

```

Compare up direction
```{r}
plotting.data <- use.dat[spid == '7126 B10' & aenm == 'CCTE_Shafer_MEA_dev_per_network_spike_spike_percent_up']
row <- list(conc = plotting.data[, concentration_unlogged],
            resp = plotting.data[, response],
            bmed = plotting.data[, unique(bmed)],
            cutoff = plotting.data[, unique(coff)],
            onesd = plotting.data[, unique(osd)],
            name = plotting.data[, unique(spid)],
            assay = plotting.data[, unique(aenm)])
res <- concRespCore(row,fitmodels = c("cnst", "hill", "gnls", "poly1", "poly2", "pow", "exp2", "exp3",
                                      "exp4", "exp5"),conthits = T, do.plot=F)
concRespPlot(res)
```

This is really weird... the models are the same (exp 4), the magnitude of the "tops" are very similar (44 and -37), so why are the AC50 values over an order of magnitude apart?

Oh wait... I just realized that the hit calls are quite near 0 in both cases!! So we would assume that the model is fitting noise in these cases.

Let's check out how many differences in AC50 cases where hitcall > 0.5
```{r}
mc5[, ac50_below_minconc_and_hit := as.numeric(hitcall > 0.5 & log10(ac50) < logc_min)]
flag.tb <- dcast(mc5, spid + acnm ~ aenm_dir, value.var = 'ac50_below_minconc_and_hit')
flag.tb[, .N, by = .(dn, up)]
```

Now only 4 cases, which seems very negligible to me.


# Check out more plots to gain confidence

```{r}
# Let's check out 3 MFR up and dn, 3 network spike peak up and dn
for (acnmi in c('CCTE_Shafer_MEA_dev_firing_rate_mean','CCTE_Shafer_MEA_dev_network_spike_peak','CCTE_Shafer_MEA_dev_mutual_information_norm','CCTE_Shafer_MEA_dev_per_burst_interspike_interval')) {
  plot.spids <- mc5[acnm == acnmi & hitcall > 0.75, unique(spid)][1:2]
  for (spidi in plot.spids) {
    for (aenm_dir in c('up','dn')) {
      plotting.data <- use.dat[spid == spidi & aenm == paste0(acnmi, '_',aenm_dir)]
      
      row <- list(conc = plotting.data[, concentration_unlogged],
                  resp = plotting.data[, response],
                  bmed = plotting.data[, unique(bmed)],
                  cutoff = plotting.data[, unique(coff)],
                  onesd = plotting.data[, unique(osd)],
                  name = plotting.data[, unique(spid)],
                  assay = plotting.data[, unique(aenm)])
      res <- concRespCore(row,fitmodels = c("cnst", "hill", "gnls", "poly1", "poly2", "pow", "exp2", "exp3",
                                            "exp4", "exp5"),conthits = T, do.plot=F)
      concRespPlot(res)
    }
  }
}
