20170607,ToxCast2016,"""The mean firing rate did not increase after DIV 7… cultures might have more dense than planned. Indicators include more LDH signal than typical, higher Cell Titer Blue signal too. The # of active electrodes on DIV 5 was much higher than normal. The nutrients most likely were exhausted on DIV 9 + DIV 12"". See Extra Notes.pdf",
