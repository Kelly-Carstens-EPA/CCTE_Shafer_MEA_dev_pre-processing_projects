# Repo for CCTE_Shafer_MEA_NFA pre-processing scripts and output

# Content that is located on the remote on the L drive (`L:\Lab\NHEERL_MEA\Carpenter_Amy\pre-process_mea_nfa_for_tcpl`), but is gitignored from the remote repo:

* All h5 files
* */All_MI/*
* */prepared_data/*

(these are just numerous and sometimes large data files, so I didn't want to push these to remote to clone. But may need to eventually, we'll see)
