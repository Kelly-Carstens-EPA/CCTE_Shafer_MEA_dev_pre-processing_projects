Al of the files in the folder All_MI, h5Files, and prepared_data and the files ToxCast2016_files_log_2020-09-04.txt, wells_with_well_quality_zero.csv, output/ToxCast2016_AUC.csv, output/ToxCast2016_pararmenters_by_DIV.csv were created by Seline Choo on her laptop (because her government-issued computer does not have R).

These files were transferred over to this folder on 09/04/2020.
I believe that the original source files that Seline copied to her computer are located here: L:\Lab\NHEERL_MEA\PIP3 - Project\Data\ToxCast tcpl prep\All files(seline)
