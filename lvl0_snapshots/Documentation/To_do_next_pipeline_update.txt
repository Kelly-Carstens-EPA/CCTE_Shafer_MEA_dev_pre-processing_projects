NOTE:
Before writing any new lvl 0 data, review the relevant OneNote notebook page for the newly pre-processed project in the pre-processing lab notebook to confirm there are no outstanding to-do items!!

* it would probably be helpful to rename the spike_duration_mean to the network_spike_duration_mean
* For every snapshot, save a clean wllq table that would be easy to map the mc0 with all the wllq notes that won't set the wllq to 0, but still important for us to note. So, if anyone every has a question on the TCPL data, that info will be available.

Date note created: May 14, 2021
Date I discovered that the aenm was corrected to "CCTE_Shafer_MEA_dev_per_network_spike_interspike_interval_mean": April 14, 2023
Note:
"Next time Katie repipelines any mea nfa data, ask if she can update the aenm for acid 2483 (aeid 2518 and 2519)
Currently, the acnm is correct, but the aenm still reflects the incorrect definition
tcplLoadAeid(fld = 'aenm', val = c('CCTE_Shafer_MEA_dev_per_network_spike_interspike_interval_mean_up',
+                                    'CCTE_Shafer_MEA_dev_per_network_spike_interspike_interval_mean_dn'), add.fld = c('acnm','acid'))
                                                                aenm aeid                                                  acnm acid
